# E-lang

E-lang is a beginner-friendly toy programming language built step by step to understand how programming languages work internally.

The goal of this project is learning — starting from reading source files, breaking code into tokens, and slowly adding execution logic.

This project is developed incrementally with daily progress and Git branching to track learning clearly.
