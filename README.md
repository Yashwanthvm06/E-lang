# E-lang

- E-lang is a beginner-friendly toy programming language built step by step to understand how programming languages work internally.
- The goal of this project is learning — starting from reading source files, breaking code into tokens, and slowly adding execution logic.
- This project is developed incrementally with daily progress and Git branching to track learning clearly.

# E-Lang Compiler
